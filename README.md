Hi, I have put here some of my side projects I was working on. Most of them are years old.

There are mainly apps for desktop Windows, macOS and mobile: Android and iOS and some utilities.
Also, one platform game I have created with Java for Windows and Android.

Many of these projects were availabie on Google Play, App Store and some, like FastCommander for macOS, I distributed on my own.

These projects are no longer supported.
